            There was a time when the heartbeat of America pulsed through its factories. The roar of machinery, the glow of molten steel, the rhythm of hands and tools working in harmony — these sounds told the story of a nation that made things. From Detroit to Pittsburgh to Cleveland to Upstate New York, towns thrived on the dignity of work and the pride of craftsmanship. Manufacturing wasn't just an industry; it was an identity.

          <p className="text-lg">
            But over time, that heartbeat faded. Production moved overseas. Automation grew faster than opportunity. Students were told that success only came with a four-year degree, and generations drifted away from the trades that once built our country's backbone. Main Streets hollowed out, and the phrase "Made in America" became a relic of the past.

          <p className="text-lg">
            Yet quietly, something remarkable has been happening. Across the country, a new era of American industry is rising — advanced manufacturing, robotics, clean energy, aerospace, and precision machining are redefining what it means to build. This is the new industrial revolution — the Titanium Economy — powered by technology, resilience, and the rediscovery of what America does best: make things that matter.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg">
            But this revival faces one defining challenge: it needs people. Machines can't innovate without human hands guiding them. Factories can't scale without skilled workers. The silent economy that keeps America running depends on the next generation of builders — welders, machinists, technicians, and makers — to carry the torch forward.

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">
            Guildustry exists for them. To connect talent to opportunity, to restore pride in the trades, and to ensure that as America rebuilds, the people who power it rise with it. Because the future of American manufacturing won't be written in boardrooms — it'll be built by those who know how to build.
